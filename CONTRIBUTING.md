BREAKING CHANGE: Response now returns objects instead of arrays
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Title**: Use conventional commit format
2. **Description**: Explain what and why
3. **Tests**: Add tests for new functionality
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs
5. **Changelog**: Breaking changes should be noted

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project style (`make fmt`)
- [ ] All tests pass (`make test`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`make lint`)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventions

## Code Style

### Rust

- Follow [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Use `rustfmt` for formatting
- Pass `clippy` with pedantic lints
- Document public APIs

### Clippy Configuration

We use strict clippy settings:

```bash
cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::pedantic -D clippy::nursery
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make coverage

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name
```

### Test Guidelines

- Test public API functionality
- Include edge cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Keep tests focused and independent

## Documentation

- Document all public items
- Include examples in doc comments
- Update README for significant changes
- Add doc tests where appropriate

```rust
/// Brief description.
///
/// More detailed explanation if needed.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use crate::function;
/// let result = function();
/// assert!(result.is_ok());
/// ```
pub fn function() -> Result<()> {
    // ...
}
```

## Reporting Issues
